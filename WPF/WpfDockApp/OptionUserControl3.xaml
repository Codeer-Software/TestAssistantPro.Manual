What contributed to the recovery were: Improvement in industrial production, principally car production that was now free from the supply restraints caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, signs of employment picking up, solid consumer spending, and a recovery in U.S. Exports. The U.S. economy continues on a moderate recovery trend in 2012 as exports are growing and business sentiment is improving both in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries."/>
